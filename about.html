    <div class="space-y-8 text-muted leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        My professional foundation is in <strong class="text-fg">urban and infrastructure planning</strong>.
        I was trained as a planner before becoming deeply involved with software, completing a
        BSc in Urban Planning at Institut Teknologi Bandung and an MSc in Infrastructure Planning,
        Appraisal, and Development at University College London.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with software not as an end in itself, but as a means to strengthen planning,
        appraisal, and decision-making processes. Cities and infrastructure systems are inherently
        spatial, complex, and data-rich — and my work focuses on using geospatial analysis,
        modelling, and automation to make those systems more legible and actionable.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, this has meant operating at the intersection of planning and engineering.
        I have supported infrastructure and transport projects by building spatial data models,
        analytical workflows, and planning tools that translate policy questions into evidence.
        My experience spans public-sector contexts, such as transport appraisal and GTFS-based
        transit modelling, as well as private-sector infrastructure development and energy planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, I have increasingly taken on technical leadership responsibilities — designing
        data pipelines, cloud environments, and geospatial platforms — while maintaining a
        planning-led perspective. I am not a software engineer at heart; rather, I use engineering
        disciplines to extend the reach and impact of urban and infrastructure planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly drawn to problems that sit between disciplines: where spatial thinking,
        infrastructure economics, policy constraints, and technical systems meet. I value clarity,
        restraint, and solutions that scale responsibly — both technically and institutionally.
